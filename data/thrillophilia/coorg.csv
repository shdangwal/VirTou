Let us get to know more about this place in details and about some of the nearby places of tourist attraction.History of Omkareshwar TempleThe temple was built in the year 1820 by one of the most successful rulers of Coorg, King Ling Rajendra II. He had built the temple as a dedication to Lord Shiva. As per mythology, King Ling Rajendra had killed a Brahmin of the state in order to fulfil some of his political ambitions. But, he was highly puzzled with afterthoughts. He used to sight bad nightmare and many intellectuals of the state suggested him to start the construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.King Ling Rajendra followed all the advice received from various forums and finally bought a Shivalinga from Kashi and placed inside the newly constructed temple. The temple was constructed in the time when Coorg had been under the influence of Islamic rulers. This influence can be seen in its structural design. As soon as it carried out this job, he stopped getting nightmares and bad thoughts. The linga in the temple constructed by him is now worshipped as Omkarehswara. Local devotees and tourists come to this temple with a great amount of belief and the temple hosts many festivals all over the year like Shiva Ratri. Many believe it to be placed to get rid of all sins. If the king can get his sins washed away, then it can also wash away the sins of anyone.The architecture of Omkareshwar TempleOmkareshwar temple is widely acknowledged for the fusion of various structural designs and artistry. You will certainly find the architecture unique. This is for the reason that the architecture of the temple is quite similar to the ones found in Muslim Dargahs. The temple has a central large dome and four minarets on the side of the main temple. However, this architecture misses one of the most prominent styles of temple architecture in South India i.e. pillared corridors. The deity in the temple is positioned close to the main entrance of the temple and you can also find all the information about the construction on the copper inscription from the main entrance door. There is a grand water tank inside the temple, which serves as a home to a number of different kinds of fish, and it is one of the most important centres of tourist attraction inside the temple.
