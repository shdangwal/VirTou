Kashibai, his mother, was suffering from a chronic foot ailment at the time and went to visit the shrine which was famous for its magical healing powers.  There, she prayed for her recovery and pledged to build a beautiful temple once she was cured of her ailment. Soon, she recovered and as per her promise, Nana Saheb constructed what is now known as the Parvati Temple on top of Parvati Hill. Another belief associated with the Parvati Hill and Temple suggests that Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, the king of the Maratha dynasty and Shivaji Maharaj’s grandson, had a special place for Nana Saheb Peshwa, who had won his confidence as well as trust. Shahu Maharaj treated the young Peshwa like his own son. Naturally, the demise of King Shahu Maharaj was an immense loss to Nana Saheb.

But you can still make these remains your window into the past to relive what has happened in history.History of Shaniwar Wada:
The foundation stone of the Shaniwar Wada was laid in 1730 by Peshwa Bajirao I. Initially, it was intended to be a colossal palace of seven stories made out of stone. But the people of the national capital argued that only King can have a castle made of stone. So, the construction of Shaniwar Wada began using bricks. It took two years to complete this elegant structure, which displayed an excellent blend of the Maratha Imperial architecture with the Mughal architecture. The interiors had valuable furniture and decorations along with carvings of flowers and paintings of scenes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. The first major fire in the year 1791 destroyed a significant part of the fort, which was re-constructed again. Then the next explosion in 1808 burnt all the necessary artifacts and documents in the palace. Then another fire in 1812 destroyed the upper two stories of the castle, followed by a fire in 1813 which destroyed the Royal Hall. All this destruction was taken to another level in the year 1818. The British attacked Shaniwar Wada, which resulted in collapsing all the top stories. Finally, in the year 1828, a fire caught the whole palace, which burned for a week and wrecked it. Architecture of Shaniwar Wada:
Architecture of Shaniwar Wada is an excellent example of Maratha style of construction blended with authentic Mughal architecture. The main gate, also known as Delhi Darwaza, is adorned with iron spikes to restrain the enemy attack as it is enormous enough to pass an elephant through it. There is a small aisle on the top of the door which has dome-shaped windows definitely taken from the Mughal architecture. Besides this gate, the Wada has four more gates, namely Mastani Darwaza, Khidki Darwaza, Ganesh Darwaja, and Narayan Darwaza. The walls have floral carvings and paintings resembling the Mughal architecture style. Scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata are also found painted at various significant spots. The windows and doors are also dome-shaped contributing to the traces of Mughal architecture. Archaeologists believe that initially, the fort was six-floored before it was destroyed by the fire.
