0,Bandipur National Park,"Once a hunting ground, ironically, Bandipur National Park was transformed into a reserve in 1974 and has been a point of interest, ever since. Replete with endangered wildlife and rich deciduous teak and sandalwood forests, Bandipur paints a unique picture that attracts tourists from near and far. 
A safari through the vast park reveals rare species like hornbills, sloth bears, panthers, and deer, roaming freely in their natural habitat. Beholding nature’s beauty, Bandipur is an epitome of Karnataka’s ever-abundant riches!

1,Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve,"Recognized as the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012, Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve encircles Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala’s various national parks and extends across a massive area of 5,520 sq. km. A trek through the reserve opens doors to splendid sights like the wildlife, the dense trees, and the incredible Western Ghats. 
The reserve boasts of elephants and tigers, primarily, since it is dedicated to the conservation of these species, but apart from that you’re sure to spot unique animals like gaurs, Indian Leopards, lion-tailed macaques, and even the Malabar giant squirrel, which is a rare sight. Prepare to set your eyes on some breathtaking beauty amidst vivid flowers, exotic plants and greenery like you’ve never seen before!

2,Gopalaswamy Betta,"Tucked away in the enormous Bandipur National Park, Gopalaswamy Betta is a majestic hill with a peak 1450 metres above sea level. The forest-clad hill is not only known for being the highest peak in the park, but for the mist that engulfs it for most of the year, giving it the name Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta, as ‘Himavad’ translates to ‘fog’ in the local language. Apart from the elephant rides here, which the spot is most popular for, another attraction that tourists flock to is the Gopalaswamy Temple, situated atop the hill. 
The temple pays tribute to one of the incarnations of Lord Krishna and is a preferred spot for solitude, especially at sunrise and sunset when the view beyond the temple soothes your soul. A place of worship amidst natural beauty is a testimony to the fact that Bandipur is more than just a scenic place.
